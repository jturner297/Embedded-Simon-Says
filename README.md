<img src="assets/STM-SAYS_thumbnailGIF.gif" width="500" />

A faithful recreation of the classic Simon memory game, built entirely on STM32 using LEDs and buttons.

## Overview
**Embedded Simon Says** recreates the iconic memory game using the **STM32L476RG microcontroller**. It features **two distinct gameplay modes**. Perfect for practicing pattern recognition or just testing your memory.



### Learning Mode 
Designed to help players memorize and study patterns at their own pace. 
  - Players can view the entire pattern from the start
  - Unlimited attempts at recreating the pattern, no penalties for mistakes
  - Goal: master the sequence

### Challenge Mode
Designed to test the player‚Äôs memory. 
  - Players must replicate an increasingly complex pattern perfectly
  - One mistakes end the gane
  - Each succesful round turns 2 more LEDs on at the end of the game
  - Goal: complete 8 rounds to light all 16 LEDs on the results screen
